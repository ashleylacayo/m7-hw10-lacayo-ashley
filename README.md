Issues:
I could not figure out how to get the name to save for some reason, I tried different ways and commented out the code of things I tried, I appreciate any help if you see what I did wrong to get the name to save. 

Resources:
Module notes were helpful along with the examples in class. I used this as guidance throughout the assignment along with the following sources:
